In context of traffic prediction Edges(E) are the  roads connecting different nodes(V) in the city.Graph partitioning works to divide the set of vertices V into disjoint partitions such that computational load is balanced. graph partitioning plays a major role in optimizing the performance of traffic prediction models working with large graph networks. Later, in this section we briefly discuss the prominent graph partitioning techniques.

Metis

METIS is a software package for partitioning large irregular graphs.METIS is a multilevel k-way partitioning technique, METIS algorithm reduces the graphs size by collapsing the vertices and edges in coarsening stage and  performing k-way partition on the reduced graph then uncoarsen it to construct partitions for the initial graph G. During refinement phase, the focus is on optimizing the region of the graph near partition boundary.



Girvan-Newman 
The Girvan-Newman algorithm is a Community detection method ( hierarchical - clustering) that unremittingly discards edges that serve as a bridge between these objects (nodes).Thus leading to communities ( densely connected subcomponents).The Girvan-Newman technique works by finding the edges that have the highest centrality and iteratively eliminating these edges to produce communities. Hence it employs edge betweenness as its metrics to perceive the significance of edges that connect nodes within a graph 


node loss:
node loss refres to loss in the nodes after the partitioning the initial graph. it s calculated as the difference between the total nodes in the initial graph and the total nodes in all subgraphs , divided by the total nodes in the initial graph .

edge loss:
edge loss refres to the reduction of edges after the partitoining the initial graph. it is calculated as the difference between total edges in the initial graph and the total edges in all subgraphs, divided by the total edges in the initial graph. a lower edge loss value is desirable as it results in more effective partition.

dataset selection:
for this study, road network datasets of three different locations were considered to evaluate various graph partition techniques. datasets were taken from the research paper. datasets with  differnet node sizes were considered to ensure extensive evaluation of the graph partitioning algorithms.


expperiments :
This section gives the destails of the experiments conduxted to evaluate the effectiveness of the various graph partitioning techniques. the goal was to judge the performance of theses techniques with various metrics.

experimental procedure:
Distinct Graph partitioning techniques and clustering techniques(METIS, Jabeja, random partitioning, Girvan-Newman,Â Asynchronous Fluid Communities Detection) are applied to the road network dataset of three cities(Houston, Dallas, Miami). inorder to evaluate the results obtained node loss, edge loss ,balance metrics are used to measure the quality of partitoins

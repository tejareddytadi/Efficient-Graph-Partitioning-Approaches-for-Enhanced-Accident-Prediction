This research explores the use of **graph partitioning techniques** to optimize the process of accident prediction in large, complex road networks. The study evaluates various partitioning methods and their effectiveness in maintaining the structural integrity of road networks while reducing computational complexity.

## **Abstract**
Graph partitioning is crucial for breaking down large datasets, allowing parallelism and scalable computation, particularly in accident prediction. This study evaluates multiple graph partitioning algorithms such as **METIS**, **Fennel Partitioning**, and **Asynchronous Fluid Communities Detection**, using the **Houston City road network** dataset. The paper highlights the importance of partitioning methods that preserve node and edge integrity, improving accuracy in accident prediction.

## **Key Highlights**
- **Graph Partitioning**: Techniques like METIS, Fennel, and Asynchronous Fluid Communities Detection are applied to partition large road networks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Node loss, edge loss, and partition balance are used to measure the performance of the partitioning techniques.
- **Accident Prediction**: Effective partitioning leads to better performance in traffic accident prediction models by improving computational efficiency and scalability.

## **Contents**
- **Research_work.ipynb**: Python notebook containing the graph partitioning analysis.
- **Conference paper ICSSIT.pdf**: Published paper in **ICSSIT 2024** detailing the methodology, results, and findings of the study.

## **Conclusion**
The study concludes that **METIS (PyTorch)** performs the best in preserving edge integrity and maintaining balanced partitions, making it highly suitable for accident prediction tasks. Other methods like **Fennel Partitioning** and **Asynchronous Fluid Communities Detection** also offer competitive performance, but with trade-offs in edge loss and partition balance.
